2004-05-24 16:06  robson

	Calculate depth one once in operator<< for tree. Depth is O(n).

2004-05-24 16:04  robson

	Added missing <string> header.

2004-05-21 16:24  robson

	Uri now throws exception when link is not valid. This is caught by
	conert_link.

	Version 0.3.

2004-05-21 15:24  robson

	Changes to work with gcc 2.95.2.

2004-05-21 14:36  robson

	Changes to accomodate new features.

2004-05-21 14:35  robson

	Removed convert_charset. Now we use CharsetConverter class. Check
	for utf8 signature in detect_utf8. Changed convert link to use the
	Uri class and not regexx.

2004-05-21 14:30  robson

	Class to check if the extension of the file in the url is in a
	given set.

2004-05-21 14:28  robson

	Class to convert from one charset to another.

2004-05-21 14:25  robson

	Changed parse method to return a const ref to the tree which is
	much more efficient. Some other optimizations to make it faster.

2004-05-21 14:20  robson

	Changed attribute method to return a pair so we can know when the
	attribute is not present or present and empty. Trim white space
	just after and just before the surrounding quotes for an attribute.

2004-05-21 14:15  robson

	Added own Uri class. We don't use regexx anymore.

2004-05-18 13:52  robson

	Added two utilities functions: detect_utf8 and convert_charset.
	Rewrote single_blank and decode_entities to be much faster and
	corrected some bugs.

2004-05-17 16:36  robson

	Changed parseAttributes the be much faster, much more resilient and
	much more like mozilla. The method was buggy and not utilized. Now
	it is better than the HTML::get_attribute and much faster. Change
	in interface: getAttributes renamed to attributes to follow coding
	guidelines.

2004-05-12 16:01  robson

	Move the Node class to a separated file.

2004-05-12 15:20  robson

	Fixed bug where we went beyond the end of the file if it ended in
	the middle of a tag or a quote inside a tag.

2004-05-10 16:30  robson

	Lots of change to the core of the html parser. Now we treat the
	tags script, style, xmp, plaintext and textarea correctly. We also
	treat non-matching closing tags as comments. We treat tags
	beginning with <? or <% as comments also. All this behavior is
	based in the HTML::Parser and in the Mozilla browser. Mozilla still
	does some magic that we don't, treating tags that don't have a
	closing '>'.

2004-04-19 12:26  robson

	Changed url fixing of "\r\n" to beginning of function.

2004-03-23 17:05  robson

	decode_entities: do not convert entity "#00" because it generates
	bogus strings.
	
	convert_link: make hostpat static to only compile the regex once.
	Remove "\r" and "\n" from link because browsers also do so.

2004-03-11 23:30  davi

2003-11-19 21:41  davi

	Initial revision

2003-11-19 21:23  davi

	whether it is worth to have a object for the parsed tree
