Bolognani

1998 Bolognani Muller-Thurgau, Trentino, Italy
Muller-Thurgau (Mew-lair Toor-gau) sounds suspiciously like a kind of sausage or a souped-up European racecar. In fact, it’s usually a boring and bland German-designed grape variety that can be transformed into something sensuous and sublime in the hands of a talented winemaker such as Diego Bolognani.
