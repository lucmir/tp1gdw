Petrucco

21)
1998 Petrucco Sauvignon Blanc, Friuli, Italy
Many Italian Sauvignon Blancs are short and simple, but Petrucco’s 1998 is a terrific exception. Its persistent, zesty components make this a wine to pair magnificently with linguini and clams in white-wine sauce. Fewer than 1,000 cases produced.
